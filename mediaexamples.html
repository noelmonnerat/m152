    <div class="post-content">
        <h4 dir="ltr">1. RAW</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">RAW files are processed directly from the camera’s sensor, thus they do not use compression.
            Because they are lossless, the images are extremely high-quality. They show more shades of colors and better
            representation of white balance, contrast, exposure &nbsp;etc. In addition, changes made to RAW files are
            non-destructive. Only the metadata that controls the rendering is altered, but the original file data
            remains untouched.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Obviously, fewer images can be saved in your memory card or hard drive due to the massive amount of
            data in the RAW file. Also, there is no widespread adoption of a standard RAW format. As such, specialized
            software may be needed to open RAW files. However, this drawback has been mitigated by using open-source
            computer programs such as dcraw.</p>
        <p>Many photographers, editors, and graphic artists use RAW images during the editing phase. However, they
            usually save the final result in a more compressed format (most likely JPEG).</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">2. DNG (Digital Negative)</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">DNG is a lossless format similar to RAW. However, unlike RAW that uses specific formats based on
            camera types or manufacturers, DNG stores image data in a compatible, generic format. Thus, even if it is
            created by Adobe for its applications, any software that can read or convert DNG format can be used.</p>
        <p>Converting RAW files to DNG is highly recommended as this will significantly decrease the size of the images,
            making them easy to download, upload, or send via email. In fact, DNG files are 15 to 20 percent smaller in
            size than RAW files without any loss of quality.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The DNG format has checksum information that is used to scan and prevent file corruption. Also,
            enhancements, new features, and extra functionalities are assured since Adobe continuously works on the DNG
            format.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">However, it takes a long time to convert RAW files into DNG. The format also removes unrecognized
            metadata from RAW files, making it virtually impossible to retrieve such data from DNG files in the future.
            Finally, since any alteration is written directly into the DNG file, you have to back up the entire file
            each time a change is made.</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">3. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">TIFF is a lossless file format which is popular among graphic artists, photographers, and
            publishers. The information is retained in layers, which depends on how you save the file. It is also a
            favorite of printers because there is no loss in quality when the image is printed. TIFF is also supported
            by various photo editing applications such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Photomatix, Google Nik, and
            more .</p>
        <p dir="ltr">A TIFF file, similar to a RAW file, is extremely large. In addition, you can’t display images on
            &nbsp;the Internet using this format.</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">4. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">Have you seen moving images (not videos) in the web? Most of these files use the GIF format. It is
            great for graphics and visuals with animation. Web designers and graphic artists also often use them to
            create sharp-eyed line artworks such as simple logos and banners. Extreme data compression considerably
            decreases the size of GIF files, allowing them to load quickly in the web.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">The biggest downside of GIF files is that the data compression makes it extremely lossy, thus it is
            not recommended for photos.</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">5. PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">PNG, originally created as an improved replacement for GIF, is a popular format used by
            photographers and graphic designers. That’s because the format supports lossless data compression, which
            means a lot of information is retained when you save and reopen your images. PNG files can be also be shared
            on the web.</p>
        <p>One of the best features of PNG is that it has transparency options. You can easily overlay a PNG image into
            a background (usually represented by a white-and-gray checkerboard), maintaining transparency and giving the
            overall photo or graphics a 3D quality. This feature also allows more efficient images editing; photo
            editors and graphic designers can easily apply their edits in layers.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">There is data compression involved but not as much as in GIFs, which allows you to retain a
            high-quality image. However, the size, although compressed, is still more than a JPEG image.</p>
        <h4 dir="ltr">6. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</h4>
        <p dir="ltr">Used by most digital cameras as their default format, JPEG is the most common file type which can
            be used online or for hard prints. Its lossy compression algorithm removes minute details that your eye is
            least likely to notice to save space. However, the compression ratio is adjustable so you can select the
            level of quality you want in your image. In general, the compression is enough to provide a reasonably
            high-quality image without worrying too much about the file size.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">A drawback of JPEG files is that unlike PNG files, the layers of a JPEG file are flattened. That
            means you have very limited ability to tweak past edits. Worse, if you edit the same file several times, the
            edited image may become worse than the original. This image degradation can be a real headache, especially
            if you are working on lossy formats such as JPEG.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">One way to mitigate this problem is to keep an unedited, original version of the file. In that way,
            if anything goes haywire during the editing process, you can always back to the original version.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">So there you have it, the five most common file types that photographers use. Each has its own
            advantages, disadvantages, features, and exigences. Which one is the right one for you?</p>

    <div id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"></div>
    <p><strong>AAC (not hi-res):</strong> Apple's alternative to MP3 – stands for 'Advanced Audio Coding'. Lossy and
        compressed, but sounds generally better. Used for Apple Music streaming.</p>
    <p><strong>AIFF (hi-res):</strong> Apple's alternative to WAV, with better metadata support. It is lossless and
        uncompressed (so big file sizes), but not hugely popular.</p>
    <p><strong>DSD (hi-res): </strong>The single-bit format
        used for Super Audio CDs. It comes in 2.8mHz, 5.6mHz and 11.2mHz varieties, but due to its high-quality codec,
        it’s (mostly) impractical for streaming. Uncompressed.</p>
    <div id="in-article" class="ad-unit"></div>
    <p><strong>FLAC (hi-res):</strong> This lossless compression format supports hi-res sample rates, takes up about
        half the space of WAV, and stores metadata. It's royalty-free and is considered the preferred format for
        downloading and storing hi-res albums. The downside is, it’s not supported by Apple (so not compatible with
        Apple Music).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>MP3 (not hi-res):</strong> Popular, lossy compressed format ensures small file size, but far from the
        best sound quality. Convenient for storing music on smartphones and iPods.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong> (hi-res):</strong> A lossless compression
        format that packages hi-res files for more efficient streaming. Used for hi-res streaming.</p>
    <p><strong>OGG (not hi-res):</strong> Sometimes called by its full name, Ogg Vorbis. A lossy, open-source
        alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by patents. The file format used (at 320kbps) in streaming.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong>WAV (hi-res):</strong> The standard format in which all CDs are encoded. Great sound quality but it's
        uncompressed, meaning huge file sizes (especially for hi-res files). It has poor metadata support (that is,
        album artwork, artist and song title information).</p>
    <p><strong>WMA Lossless (hi-res):</strong> A lossless incarnation of Windows Media Audio, but no longer
        well-supported by smartphones or tablets.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="compressed-vs-uncompressed-audio-files">Compressed vs. uncompressed audio files</h2>
    <p>First, let’s talk about the three categories all audio files can be grouped into. It comes down to how compressed
        the data is (if at all) and as a result, how much quality or “loss” you’ll experience, as a listener.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If no compression algorithm (or codec) has been used to compress the audio within your file, two things happen:
        zero loss in sound quality, and soon-enough, a “startup disk full” warning on your laptop.</p>
    <p>Essentially, an uncompressed track is a reproduction of the original audio file, where real-world signals are
        transformed into digital audio.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="wav-vs-aiff-vs-flac-uncompressed-file-formats">WAV vs AIFF vs FLAC: uncompressed file formats</h2>
    <div class="mid__article"></div>
    <p>WAV and AIFF are arguably the most popular uncompressed audio file formats, both based on PCM (Pulse Code
        Modulation), which is widely recognised as the most straightforward audio storage mechanism in the digital
        domain. Both WAV and AIFF files use similar technology, but store data in slightly different ways.&nbsp;They can
        store CD-quality or high-resolution audio files.</p>
    <p>WAV was developed by Microsoft and IBM, hence it's used in Windows-based platforms, and is the standard format
        all CDs are encoded in.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AIFF was developed by Apple as an alternative to WAV, and although not as widely popular, AIFF files have better
        metadata support, meaning you can include album artwork, song titles and the like.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The drawback? These babies are big. A CD-quality (16-bit, 44.1kHz) file will take around 10MB of your hard drive
        per minute in length.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="alac-vs-flac-vs-wma-lossless-lossless-audio-formats">ALAC vs FLAC vs WMA Lossless: lossless audio
        formats</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a FLAC. A lossless file, the FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is compressed to nearly half the
        size of an uncompressed WAV or AIFF of equivalent sample rate, but there should be no “loss” in terms of how it
        sounds. FLAC files can also provide a resolution of up to 32-bit, 96kHz, so better than CD-quality.</p>
    <p>Other lossless audio file formats include ALAC (Apple Lossless) and WMA Lossless (Windows Media Audio). The
        former is a good iOS and iTunes compatible alternative to FLAC, although the files are slightly less compact
        than FLACs.&nbsp;Check for and tablet compatibility, though.</p>
    <h2 id="aac-vs-mp3-lossy-audio-formats">AAC vs MP3: lossy audio formats</h2>
    <p>Who’s heard of an MP3? Course you have. Steve Jobs famously pulled 1000 of them out of his pocket on 23rd October
        2001. It is easily the most common audio format, and MP3s are convenient for storing music on portable players
        or tablets and work on almost all playback devices. But to do that, you have to lose a load of information in
        the process. In order to make audio files up to ten times smaller than CD quality files, some original data must
        be discarded, resulting in a loss of sound quality.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The bit-rate at which an MP3 is recorded also affects the sound quality. MP3s encoded at 128kbps will incur more
        sound loss than those encoded at 320kbps (kilobits per second, where each “bit” is essentially a “piece” of the
        song). Now that storage is so much cheaper, we'd avoid 128kbps at all costs, though 320kbps MP3s still have
        their purpose if your storage is limited – and they remain a standard on download stores.</p>
    <p>Another lossy format is AAC (Apple's Advanced Audio Coding) which is compressed much like an MP3, but it’s
        slightly more efficient and sounds better. AAC is used for Apple Music streaming (at 256kbps) and YouTube
        streaming.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Vorbis format, often called Ogg Vorbis owing to its Ogg container, (the best way to think of this is that OGG
        is the can, Vorbis is the ring-pull) is a lossy, open-source alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by
        patents. Ogg Vorbis is the file format used (at 320kbps) in Spotify streaming.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you’re sticking with lossy, it’s worth remembering this: while more “bits” usually means better sound, it
        depends on the efficiency of the codec in your file. Although you might notice that much of the music in your
        collection is encoded at 128kbps so should be much of a muchness, an MP3 will likely sound a fair bit (see what
        we did there?) worse than an AAC or Ogg Vorbis file, due to the inefficiency of the codec in an MP3.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="what-about-high-resolution-audio">What about high-resolution audio?</h2>
    <p>Unlike high-definition video, there’s no single universal standard when it comes to .</p>
    <p>However, in its simplest terms, hi-res audio tends to refer to music files which have a higher sampling frequency
        and/or bit depth than CD – which is specified at 16-bit/44.1kHz. Hi-res files therefore come in the form of
        16-bit/96kHz or 24-bit/192kHz, for example.</p>
    <p>So why should you care? Quite simply, hi-res audio files have a lot of extra audio information and thus sound a
        lot better than compressed audio formats, which lose information in the compression process. They will take up
        more storage space but we definitely think it's worth the trade off.</p>
    <p>Uncompressed files like AIFF and WAV are hi-res, as are those lossless FLAC and ALAC file formats.&nbsp;DSD (the
        somewhat niche format used for Super Audio CDs) is also hi-res, but it’s not as widely supported. When it comes
        to streaming, MQA is a file packing format used by the likes of ,
        which helps to bring hi-res audio to streaming services using as little bandwidth as possible.</p>
    <p>As for playing hi-res audio, an increasing amount of products now support it. Premium portable music players such
        as the Award-winning plus the newer and rather splendid support
        24-bit/192kHz WAV,&nbsp;, ALAC and AIFF files. Both players boast DSD128 file compatibility
        too – and that support is native, so&nbsp;&nbsp;files aren’t converted to PCM during playback.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The and another 2020 Award-winner, the digital audio players are like many A&amp;K players (including the
        entry-level&nbsp;) in that file support goes all the way up to 32-bit/384kHz and includes native DSD256 and&nbsp;
        &nbsp;playback.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>KEF's new LS50 Wireless II speakers will play 24-bit/192kHz files in all their glory, and support for DSD256 is
        also onboard too this time, as is&nbsp;&nbsp;decoding
        for the playback of compatible downloaded files and hi-res&nbsp;.
    </p>
    <p>Hi-res audio can also be played on most flagship Android , but you can’t play hi-res on a box-fresh iPhone. We’ve
        found , but it’s worth remembering that hi-res audio isn’t quite as portable as its lossy brethren
        – yet. You can find more info on which hi-fi products support hi-res audio .</p>
