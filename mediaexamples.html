    <div id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"></div>
    <p><strong>AAC (not hi-res):</strong> Apple's alternative to MP3 – stands for 'Advanced Audio Coding'. Lossy and
        compressed, but sounds generally better. Used for Apple Music streaming.</p>
    <p><strong>AIFF (hi-res):</strong> Apple's alternative to WAV, with better metadata support. It is lossless and
        uncompressed (so big file sizes), but not hugely popular.</p>
    <p><strong>DSD (hi-res): </strong>The single-bit format
        used for Super Audio CDs. It comes in 2.8mHz, 5.6mHz and 11.2mHz varieties, but due to its high-quality codec,
        it’s (mostly) impractical for streaming. Uncompressed.</p>
    <div id="in-article" class="ad-unit"></div>
    <p><strong>FLAC (hi-res):</strong> This lossless compression format supports hi-res sample rates, takes up about
        half the space of WAV, and stores metadata. It's royalty-free and is considered the preferred format for
        downloading and storing hi-res albums. The downside is, it’s not supported by Apple (so not compatible with
        Apple Music).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>MP3 (not hi-res):</strong> Popular, lossy compressed format ensures small file size, but far from the
        best sound quality. Convenient for storing music on smartphones and iPods.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.whathifi.com/advice/mqa-audio-what-it-how-can-you-get-it"

    <p><strong>OGG (not hi-res):</strong> Sometimes called by its full name, Ogg Vorbis. A lossy, open-source
        alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by patents. The file format used (at 320kbps) in <a
                href="https://www.whathifi.com/spotify/review" data-component-tracked="1">Spotify</a> streaming.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p><strong>WAV (hi-res):</strong> The standard format in which all CDs are encoded. Great sound quality but it's
        uncompressed, meaning huge file sizes (especially for hi-res files). It has poor metadata support (that is,
        album artwork, artist and song title information).</p>
    <p><strong>WMA Lossless (hi-res):</strong> A lossless incarnation of Windows Media Audio, but no longer
        well-supported by smartphones or tablets.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="compressed-vs-uncompressed-audio-files">Compressed vs. uncompressed audio files</h2>
    <p>First, let’s talk about the three categories all audio files can be grouped into. It comes down to how compressed
        the data is (if at all) and as a result, how much quality or “loss” you’ll experience, as a listener.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If no compression algorithm (or codec) has been used to compress the audio within your file, two things happen:
        zero loss in sound quality, and soon-enough, a “startup disk full” warning on your laptop.</p>
    <p>Essentially, an uncompressed track is a reproduction of the original audio file, where real-world signals are
        transformed into digital audio.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="wav-vs-aiff-vs-flac-uncompressed-file-formats">WAV vs AIFF vs FLAC: uncompressed file formats</h2>
    <div class="mid__article"></div>
    <p>WAV and AIFF are arguably the most popular uncompressed audio file formats, both based on PCM (Pulse Code
        Modulation), which is widely recognised as the most straightforward audio storage mechanism in the digital
        domain. Both WAV and AIFF files use similar technology, but store data in slightly different ways.&nbsp;They can
        store CD-quality or high-resolution audio files.</p>
    <p>WAV was developed by Microsoft and IBM, hence it's used in Windows-based platforms, and is the standard format
        all CDs are encoded in.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AIFF was developed by Apple as an alternative to WAV, and although not as widely popular, AIFF files have better
        metadata support, meaning you can include album artwork, song titles and the like.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The drawback? These babies are big. A CD-quality (16-bit, 44.1kHz) file will take around 10MB of your hard drive
        per minute in length.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="alac-vs-flac-vs-wma-lossless-lossless-audio-formats">ALAC vs FLAC vs WMA Lossless: lossless audio
        formats</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a FLAC. A lossless file, the FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is compressed to nearly half the
        size of an uncompressed WAV or AIFF of equivalent sample rate, but there should be no “loss” in terms of how it
        sounds. FLAC files can also provide a resolution of up to 32-bit, 96kHz, so better than CD-quality.</p>
    <p>Other lossless audio file formats include ALAC (Apple Lossless) and WMA Lossless (Windows Media Audio). The
        former is a good iOS and iTunes compatible alternative to FLAC, although the files are slightly less compact
        than FLACs.&nbsp;Check for <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/best-smartphones"
                                      data-original-url="https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/best-phones-2020-the-best-smartphones-for-music-and-movies"
                                      data-component-tracked="1">smartphone</a> and tablet compatibility, though.</p>
    <h2 id="aac-vs-mp3-lossy-audio-formats">AAC vs MP3: lossy audio formats</h2>
    <p>Who’s heard of an MP3? Course you have. Steve Jobs famously pulled 1000 of them out of his pocket on 23rd October
        2001. It is easily the most common audio format, and MP3s are convenient for storing music on portable players
        or tablets and work on almost all playback devices. But to do that, you have to lose a load of information in
        the process. In order to make audio files up to ten times smaller than CD quality files, some original data must
        be discarded, resulting in a loss of sound quality.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The bit-rate at which an MP3 is recorded also affects the sound quality. MP3s encoded at 128kbps will incur more
        sound loss than those encoded at 320kbps (kilobits per second, where each “bit” is essentially a “piece” of the
        song). Now that storage is so much cheaper, we'd avoid 128kbps at all costs, though 320kbps MP3s still have
        their purpose if your storage is limited – and they remain a standard on download stores.</p>
    <p>Another lossy format is AAC (Apple's Advanced Audio Coding) which is compressed much like an MP3, but it’s
        slightly more efficient and sounds better. AAC is used for Apple Music streaming (at 256kbps) and YouTube
        streaming.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Vorbis format, often called Ogg Vorbis owing to its Ogg container, (the best way to think of this is that OGG
        is the can, Vorbis is the ring-pull) is a lossy, open-source alternative to MP3 and AAC, unrestricted by
        patents. Ogg Vorbis is the file format used (at 320kbps) in Spotify streaming.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you’re sticking with lossy, it’s worth remembering this: while more “bits” usually means better sound, it
        depends on the efficiency of the codec in your file. Although you might notice that much of the music in your
        collection is encoded at 128kbps so should be much of a muchness, an MP3 will likely sound a fair bit (see what
        we did there?) worse than an AAC or Ogg Vorbis file, due to the inefficiency of the codec in an MP3.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="what-about-high-resolution-audio">What about high-resolution audio?</h2>
    <p>Unlike high-definition video, there’s no single universal standard when it comes to <a
            href="https://www.whathifi.com/advice/high-resolution-audio-everything-you-need-to-know"
            data-component-tracked="1">high-resolution audio</a>.</p>
    <p>However, in its simplest terms, hi-res audio tends to refer to music files which have a higher sampling frequency
        and/or bit depth than CD – which is specified at 16-bit/44.1kHz. Hi-res files therefore come in the form of
        16-bit/96kHz or 24-bit/192kHz, for example.</p>
    <p>So why should you care? Quite simply, hi-res audio files have a lot of extra audio information and thus sound a
        lot better than compressed audio formats, which lose information in the compression process. They will take up
        more storage space but we definitely think it's worth the trade off.</p>
    <p>Uncompressed files like AIFF and WAV are hi-res, as are those lossless FLAC and ALAC file formats.&nbsp;DSD (the
        somewhat niche format used for Super Audio CDs) is also hi-res, but it’s not as widely supported. When it comes
        to streaming, MQA is a file packing format used by the likes of <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/tidal/review"
                                                                           data-component-tracked="1">Tidal Masters</a>,
        which helps to bring hi-res audio to streaming services using as little bandwidth as possible.</p>
    <p>As for playing hi-res audio, an increasing amount of products now support it. Premium portable music players such
